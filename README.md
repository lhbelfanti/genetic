# First Genetic Algorithm

This is an implmentation of my first generic algorithm.
Starting off a randomly generated population it will try to reach the target chromosome {1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0} in the least amount of generations.
Each population has 8 chromosomes and each chromosome has 10 genes (because of the genes of the target chromosome).

The target chromosome and the population size can be modified on the GeneticAlgorithm class.
